# Introduction

In my backend work, I specialize in languages like Golang, NodeJs, and Java. I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from developing APIs to integrating third-party services, and I take pride in delivering clean, efficient code.

My frontend work focuses on creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces using technologies such as React and Vue. I believe that good design is just as important as good functionality, and I'm always looking for ways to improve the user experience.

In addition to my development work, I'm also experienced in DevOps practices, using tools like Docker and AWS to streamline workflows and improve collaboration. I believe that the key to successful software development is communication and teamwork, and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to a positive, collaborative environment.

I'm passionate about software development and I'm willing to learn in further ways to improve my own skills and performance in the future. I believe that there's always something new to learn and I'm excited to continue growing and evolving as a developer.

# Certificate Experience

Asia Pacific Language Centre (Event)

- This is an event to meet more people and increase your social and communication skills. What I liked most was some of the activities that the event organizers came up with. It's a benefit for introverts.

Cybersecurity Talk "Are you safe" (Event)

- This is an event to recognize the issue of Internet security. The organizers presented the Internet security issues on stage. The organizers presented and practiced on stage how hackers can log into our computers or use internet routers to take control of our computers and rob us of our internet access. It made me realize that the hackers in the movie were all scammers. The hackers in the movie were all crooks, but it also piqued my interest in cybersecurity. If there is another event like this, I would love to participate!

Python Competition - "PYPRO" (Event)

- This was my first intramural coding competition, and of course, I didn't place on the field. Even though I tried my best, I felt happy because I gained a lot of experience and learned about the tension of the competition.

# Work Experience

Perksense Sdn Bhd

- Software Engineer
- 2021 Feb - 2022 Feb
- Internship - Software Engineer
- Project description: I had the opportunity to work on a food delivery project called Koodoo. As a full-stack developer, I worked on both the frontend and backend components of the project. On the frontend, I utilized my experience with React Native and React JS to create an intuitive user interface that allowed admins to easily manage orders, menus, and deliveries. On the backend, I worked with NodeJS to build a scalable and efficient API that powered the app. I integrated third-party services, such as payment gateways, to enhance the functionality of the app and ensure a seamless experience for users.
- Experience gain: The Koodoo project was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I'm proud of the work that our team accomplished. It allowed me to further develop my skills in both frontend and backend development, as well as project management and teamwork.
